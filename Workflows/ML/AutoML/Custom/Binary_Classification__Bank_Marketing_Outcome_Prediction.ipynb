    "Here, we will use AutoML(Automated Machine Learning) functionality to automate the entire process of developing a predictive model. It will perform feature exploration, feature engineering, data preparation, model training and evaluation on dataset in custom run and at end we will get leaderboard containined different models along with their performance. Model will also have rank associated with them which indicates which is best performing model for given data followed by other models.\n",

    "As part of custom AutoML run, we will customize below functionalities:\n",
    "- Binning on 'day_of_month' feature :\n",

    "- Ordinal encoding on 'education' and 'job' features :\n",
    "    - Aim is to get education and job features encoded with rank rather than default encoding i.e., one-hot encoding."
