    "The housing price dataset contains range of features associated with residential properties, including their physical attributes, amenities, and location-related characteristics. It is a common type of dataset used for regression or predictive modeling tasks in the field of real estate or housing market analysis. \n",
    "\n",
    "Here are some key details about the Housing dataset:\n",
    "\n",
    "**Features**:\n",
    "\n",
    "- `sn`: Serial number or identifier for each housing entry.\n",
    "- `lotsize`: The size of the lot or land associated with the property, typically measured in square feet.\n",
    "- `bedrooms`: The number of bedrooms in the house, indicating the sleeping spaces.\n",
    "- `bathrms`: The number of bathrooms in the house, reflecting the sanitary facilities available.\n",
    "- `stories`: The number of stories or levels in the house, indicating its vertical structure.\n",
    "- `driveway`: A binary variable indicating the presence or absence of a driveway for vehicular access.\n",
    "- `recroom`: A binary variable indicating whether the house has a recreation room.\n",
    "- `fullbase`: A binary variable indicating the presence or absence of a full basement in the house.\n",
    "- `gashw`: A binary variable indicating whether the house has a gas hot water heating system.\n",
    "- `airco`: A binary variable indicating the presence or absence of air conditioning in the house.\n",
    "- `garagepl`: The number of parking spaces available in the garage.\n",
    "- `prefarea`: A binary variable indicating whether the house is located in a preferred or desirable area.\n",
    "- `homestyle`: A categorical variable representing the style or type of the house.\n",
    "\n",
    "**Target Variable**:\n",
    "\n",
    "- `price`: The price of the house, representing the cost or value of the property.\n",
    "        \n",
    "**Objective**:\n",
    "\n",
    "The main objective is typically to build a predictive model that can accurately predict prices of residential property based on various features. \n",
    "\n",
    "**Challenges**:\n",
    "\n",
    "- Potential challenges in working with this dataset may include handling missing or skewed data.\n",
    "- Managing categorical variables like 'homestyle' and addressing the complexities associated with predicting housing prices.\n",
    "\n",
    "**Usecase**:\n",
    "\n",
    "Here, we will use AutoML(Automated Machine Learning) functionality to automate the entire process of developing a predictive model. It will perform feature exploration, feature engineering, data preparation, model training and evaluation on dataset in custom run and at end we will get leaderboard containined different models along with their performance. Model will also have rank associated with them which indicates which is best performing model for given data followed by other models.\n",
    "\n",
    "As part of custom AutoML run, we will customize below functionalities:\n",
    "- Binning on 'bedrooms' feature to get 2 different levels i.e., 'small_house' and 'big_house' based on values.\n",
    "- Customized ordinal encoding on 'homestyle' and target encoding on 'prefarea'.\n",
    "- Deletion of id column 'sn' using antiselect.\n",
    "- Train test split with training size 0.75.\n",
    "- Outlier filteration with 'percentile' method and customized lower-upper bound.\n",
    "- Feature scaling with 'std' method.\n",
    "- Addition of customized value in hyperparameter 'min_node_size' for 'xgboost' model."
