## Workflows showcasing capabilities of Teradata Python package for Advanced Analytics.

AutoML, or Automated Machine Learning, represents a method for streamlining the entire process of machine learning 
pipeline in automated way. Teradataml AutoML consists of five different phases covering different processes in 
automated way:
* #### Feature Exploration: It explores available features and provide insights such as column summary, categorical 
  features distinct count, outlier percentage details, futile column details, and target column distribution.
* #### Feature Engineering: It handles data anomalies such as duplicate rows handling, missing value handling, futile 
  column handling. Additionally, it executes various feature transformations based on the data types of the features.
* #### Data Preparation: It performs various steps to prepare the data for model training, including feature selection, 
  feature scaling, and splitting the data into training and validation sets.
* #### Model Training: It performs hyperparameter tuning with available models.
* #### Model Evaluation: It assesses various trained models and generates a model leaderboard that includes performance 
  metrics, detail on the applied feature selection method, and corresponding rankings for each model in ascending order. The model ranked 1 indicates the best-performing model for the given dataset.
